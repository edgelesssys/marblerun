# Service Authentication

A freshly spawned microservice (marble in our terms) will try to register and activate itselfe by sendig an activation request to the coordinator.
This request contains a quote and a certificate signing request (CSR).
The quote allows the coordinator(using remote attestation, TODO link here) to verify wether the origin of the request is actually running the service it claims, on the hardware it claims. 
The CSR contains a certificate generated by the marble, which will be signed by the coordinator if the marble and the hardware it's running on are specified in the manifest.

A client now only has to perform a remote attestation on the coordinator, obtain its root certificate and use it as a trusted certificate authority. 
Since all valid services(and only valid ones) have a certificate signed by this CA, they now can be authenticated.
