# Confidential computing

Confidential computing protects data in use by performing computation in hardware-based secure enclaves. The most prominent enclave to date is probably [Intel SGX](https://www.intel.de/content/www/de/de/architecture-and-technology/software-guard-extensions.html). 
Enclaves prevent unauthorized access or modification of applications and data while in use, thereby increasing the security assurances for organizations that manage sensitive and regulated data.
For information about confidential computing, see the Confidential Computing Consortium [white paper](https://confidentialcomputing.io/white-papers/).
