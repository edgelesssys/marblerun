# Confidential Computing

Confidential Computing protects data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment.
These secure and isolated environments prevent unauthorized access or modification of applications and data while in use, thereby increasing the security assurances for organizations that manage sensitive and regulated data.
For information about confidential computing, see the Confidential Computing Consortium [white-paper](https://confidentialcomputing.io/white-papers/).
