# Coordinator

The Coordinator is MarbleRun's control plane.
It communicates with the Marble's data plane through gRPC and provides an HTTP REST interface on the client-side.
The Coordinator can be configured with several environment variables:

* `EDG_COORDINATOR_MESH_ADDR`: The listener address for the gRPC server
* `EDG_COORDINATOR_CLIENT_ADDR`: The listener address for the HTTP REST server
* `EDG_COORDINATOR_DNS_NAMES`: The DNS names for the cluster's root certificate
* `EDG_COORDINATOR_SEAL_DIR`: The file path for storing sealed data

The Coordinator clients can be divided into two major groups.

* The owners/providers/administrators who need to interact with the Coordinator for deploying their confidential application and administrative tasks
* The users/customers who use the Coordinator for remote attestation and establishing trust with the application

The [Client API](../reference/coordinator.md) serves both use-cases with a compact HTTP REST API.
