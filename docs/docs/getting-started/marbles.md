# Marbles

Marbles are MarbleRun's data planes and run your application code in secure enclaves within otherwise regular Docker containers. Marbles communicate with the Coordinator via gRPC over TLS. See the [Add a Service](../workflows/add-service.md) section on how to build and configure a Marble.
