# Command Line Interface (CLI)

We provide a command-line interface (CLI) for MarbleRun.
This CLI allows you to install MarbleRun on your cluster and interacts with the control plane through the Client API for all administrative tasks in the service mesh.

## Installation

To install the MarbleRun CLI on your machine you can use our pre-built binaries.

**For the current user**

```bash
wget -P ~/.local/bin https://github.com/edgelesssys/marblerun/releases/latest/download/marblerun
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/marblerun
```

**Global install (requires root)**

```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/marblerun https://github.com/edgelesssys/marblerun/releases/latest/download/marblerun
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/marblerun
```

To build the MarbleRun CLI, [Edgeless RT](https://github.com/edgelesssys/edgelessrt) needs to be installed on your machine.

```bash
go build -o marblerun github.com/edgelesssys/marblerun/cli
```

To list all available commands, either run `marblerun` with no commands or execute `marblerun help`
The output is the following:

```

```

### Requirements

If the Coordinator is running on an Azure VM, the CLI relies on the [Azure DCAP Client](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-DCAP-Client) to verify quotes.
To install the dependency run:
```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/18.04/prod bionic main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/msprod.list
wget -qO - https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install az-dcap-client
```

## Command `certificate`

Get the root and/or intermediate certificates of the MarbleRun Coordinator.

**Flags**
These flags apply to all `certificate` subcommands

## Command `completion`
Generate a shell script to enable autocompletion for `marblerun` commands.
Supported shells are:
* `bash`:
  * To enable completion run:
    ```bash
    source <(marblerun completion bash)
    ```

* `zsh`:
  * If completion is not already enabled you need to enable it first:
    ```bash
    echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
    ```
  * Enable completion for `marblerun`:
    ```bash
    marblerun completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_marblerun"
    ```


Once enabled, command completion is just one keypress away:\
  `marblerun ma`+<kbd>Tab</kbd> completes to:\
  `marblerun manifest`


## Command `gramine-prepare`
This command helps you if you want to add Gramine-based services to your MarbleRun service mesh.
It prepares your Gramine project to be used as a Marble by replacing the original entrypoint of your application with the bootstrapping Marble premain process which eventually spawns your application.
Given your [Gramine manifest template](https://gramine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manifest-syntax.html), it will suggest the required adjustments needed and adds our bootstrapping data-plane code to your Gramine image.
See [Building a service: Gramine](building-services/gramine.md) for detailed information on MarbleRunâ€™s Gramine integration and our changes in your Gramine manifest.

Please note that this only works on a best-effort basis and may not instantly work correctly.
While suggestions should be made for every valid TOML Gramine configuration, changes can only be performed for non-hierarchically sorted configurations. as the official Gramine examples.
The unmodified manifest is saved as a backup under the old path with an added ".bak" suffix, allowing you to try out and roll back any changes performed.

Remember, you need to create a [MarbleRun manifest](workflows/define-manifest.md) in addition to the Gramine manifest. Adding Gramine packages to your manifest is straightforward and follows the same principles as any other SGX enclave. If you configured the arguments to your Gramine application through the [Gramine manifest](https://gramine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manifest-syntax.html#command-line-arguments) before, you need to transfer those to the [MarbleRun manifest](workflows/define-manifest.md#manifestmarbles">}}).

  **Usage**

  ```bash
  marblerun gramine-prepare <path>
  ```

  **Examples**
  ```bash
  marblerun gramine-prepare nginx.manifest.template
  ```

  Output:
  ```bash
  Reading file: nginx.manifest.template

  MarbleRun suggests the following changes to your Gramine manifest:
  libos.entrypoint = "file:premain-libos"
  loader.argv0_override = "$(INSTALL_DIR)/sbin/nginx"
  loader.insecure__use_host_env = 1
  sgx.allowed_files.marblerun_uuid = "file:uuid"
  sgx.enclave_size = "1024M"
  sgx.remote_attestation = 1
  sgx.thread_num = 16
  sgx.trusted_files.marblerun_premain = "file:premain-libos"
  Do you want to automatically apply the suggested changes [y/n]? y
  Applying changes...
  Saving original manifest as nginx.manifest.template.bak...
  Saving changes to nginx.manifest.template...
  Downloading MarbleRun premain from GitHub...
  Successfully downloaded premain-libos.

  Done! You should be good to go for MarbleRun!
  ```

          "world": {
              "Debug": true
          }
      },
      "Marbles": {
          "hello": {
              "Package": "world",
              "Parameters": {}
          }
      }
  }
  }
  ```

* ### `log`

  Retrieves a structured log of updates to the manifest. This allows users to easily check what the currently supported security versions are and if certain secrets have been set by another user.

  **Usage**

  ```bash
  marblerun manifest log <IP:PORT> [flags]
  ```

  **Flags**

  | Name, shorthand | Default | Description                                    |

  ```
  Successfully verified Coordinator, now requesting update log
  Update log:
  {"time":"2021-07-01T09:10:23.128Z","update":"initial manifest set"}
  {"time":"2021-07-01T09:32:54.207Z","update":"secret set","user":"admin","secret":"symmetricKeyUnset","type":"symmetric-key"}
  {"time":"2021-07-01T09:32:54.207Z","update":"secret set","user":"admin","secret":"certUnset","type":"cert-ed25519"}
  {"time":"2021-07-01T10:05:44.791Z","update":"SecurityVersion increased","user":"admin","package":"world","new version":4}
  ```

* ### `signature`

  Print the signature of a MarbleRun manifest.
  The manifest can be in either JSON or YAML format.

  **Usage**

  ```bash
  marblerun manifest signature manifest.json
  ```

  The output is the sha256 hash in base64 encoding of the manifest as it would be interpreted by the MarbleRun Coordinator.
  Note, that Internally, the Coordinator handles the manifest in JSON format. Hence, the signature is always based on the JSON format of your manifest.

* ### `verify`
  Verifies that the signature returned by the Coordinator is equal to a local signature.
  Can be used to quickly verify the integrity of the installed manifest.
  You can provide a signature directly, or a manifest in either JSON or YAML format.

  **Usage**

  ```bash
  marblerun manifest verify <manifest/signature> <IP:PORT> [flags]
  ```

  **Examples**

  ```bash
  marblerun manifest verify manifest.json $MARBLERUN
  ```

  ```bash
  marblerun manifest verify 152493c4a85845480a04b95f79dd447a4573862e0d2c102c71b91b8b3cbcade5 $MARBLERUN
  ```

  If the signatures match, the output is the following:
  ```bash
  OK
  ```

## Command `precheck`

  Check if your Kubernetes cluster supports SGX.
  More precisely the command will check if any nodes in the cluster define SGX resources through the use of [Device Plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/device-plugins/).
  Currently supported are:
  * [Intel SGX Device Plugin](https://intel.github.io/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes/cmd/sgx_plugin/README.html), exposing the resources:
    * `sgx.intel.com/enclave`
    * `sgx.intel.com/epc`
    * `sgx.intel.com/provision`


  * [Azure SGX Device Plugin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-nodes-aks-overview#azure-device-plugin-for-intel-sgx-), exposing the resource:
    * `kubernetes.azure.com/sgx_epc_mem_in_MiB`

  **Usage**

  ```bash
  marblerun precheck
  ```

  * If your cluster does not support SGX the output is the following:

  ```bash
  Cluster does not support SGX, you may still run MarbleRun in simulation mode
  To install MarbleRun run [marblerun install --simulation]
  ```

  * If your cluster does support SGX the output is similar to the following

  ```bash
  Cluster supports SGX on 2 nodes
  To install MarbleRun run [marblerun install]
  ```

## Command `recover`

Recover the MarbleRun Coordinator from a sealed state by uploading a recovery key.
