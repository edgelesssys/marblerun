# Marbles

Marbles are MarbleRun's data planes and run your application code in secure enclaves.
Marbles communicate with the Coordinator via gRPC over TLS.
MarbleRun [supports multiple enclave runtimes](../features/runtimes.md) as the data plane.
See the [Add a Service](../workflows/add-service.md) section on how to build and configure an enclave as Marble.
