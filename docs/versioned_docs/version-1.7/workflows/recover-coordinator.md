# Recovering the Coordinator

Different situations require the [recovery](../features/recovery.md) of the Coordinator.
If the Coordinator fails to unseal its state, it will enter recovery mode.

:::tip

Use [distributed Coordinator instances](../features/recovery.md#distributed-coordinator) to reduce the occurrence of events that require manual recovery.

:::

You need the corresponding private key to the [`RecoveryKeys` defined in the manifest](define-manifest.md#recoverykeys) and the [recovery secret returned to you during the initial upload of the manifest](set-manifest.md).

:::info

If you don't want or can't recover the old state, you can also dismiss it by [uploading a new manifest](set-manifest.md).
The old state will be overwritten on disk, and recovery won't be available anymore.

:::

To recover the Coordinator, you need to decode your recovery secret and upload it using the MarbleRun CLI.

Assuming you named your recovery key `recoverKey1` in the manifest, and you saved the output from the manifest upload step in a file called `recovery_data`, decode your secret with the following command:

```bash
jq -r '.RecoverySecrets.recoverKey1' recovery_data | openssl base64 -d > recovery_key_encrypted
```

:::caution

If you generated the private recovery key using `openssl` version 1, the key will be in PKCS #1 format.
MarbleRun requires the key to be in PKCS #8 format.

Use the following command to convert the key:

```bash
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in private_key.pem -out private_key_pkcs8.pem -nocrypt
```

:::

Then decrypt and upload the extracted secret using the MarbleRun CLI:

```bash
marblerun recover recovery_key_encrypted $MARBLERUN --key private_key.pem
```

On success, the Coordinator applies the sealed state again. If the Coordinator can't restore the state with the uploaded key, an error will be returned in the logs, and the recovery endpoint will stay open for further interaction.

## Multi-party recovery

<EnterpriseBanner/>

If you've [configured your MarbleRun deployment for multi-party recovery](define-manifest.md#multi-party-recovery), send each party the corresponding [recovery secret](set-manifest.md). Ask them to perform the steps above. Once all parties have uploaded their secrets, the Coordinator recovers the sealed state and continues its operations.

:::note

If your MarbleRun deployment uses [distributed Coordinator instances](../features/recovery.md#distributed-coordinator), make sure all parties send their secrets to the same Coordinator instance.
One way to achieve this is scaling the Coordinator to a single instance:

```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=1 -n marblerun deployment/marblerun-coordinator
```

After recovery, you can scale the Coordinator back to the desired number of instances.

:::

### Example

The following gives an example of a multi-party recovery workflow.

Assume the following `RecoveryKeys` were set in the manifest:

```javascript
    "RecoveryKeys": {
        "alice": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIICIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAg8AMIICCgKCAgEAk/6gfFF+cbcTlj8MT+4M\njjpM+suTwNM9gjv47EAAQ==\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n",
        "bob": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIICIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAg8AMIICCgKCAgEAsnOEAvynVrbgLdp0lwcp\nk2k04+n4op6tp1Yw2OaDbEAAQ==\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
    }
```

1. The Coordinator returned the following `RecoverySecrets`:

    ```shell-session
    $ marblerun manifest set manifest.json $MARBLERUN
    ...
    {"RecoverySecrets":{"alice":"EbkX/skIPrJISf8PiXdzRIKnwQyJ+VejtGzHGfES5NIPuCeEFedqgCVDk=","bob":"bvPzio4A4SvzeHajsb+dFDpDarErcU9wMR0V9hyHtG2lC4ZfyrYjDBE7wtis3eOPgDaMG/HCt="}}
    ```

2. Alice decrypts and uploads her recovery key using her private key `private_key.pem` as follows:

    ```shell-session
    $ marblerun status $MARBLERUN
    1: Coordinator is in recovery mode. Either upload a key to unseal the saved state, or set a new manifest. For more information on how to proceed, consult the documentation.
    $ echo "EbkX/skIPrJISf8PiXdzRIKnwQyJ+VejtGzHGfES5NIPuCeEFedqgCVDk=" > recovery_data
    $ openssl base64 -d -in recovery_data > recovery_key_encrypted
    $ marblerun recover recovery_key_encrypted $MARBLERUN --key private_key.pem
    Successfully verified Coordinator, now uploading key
    Secret was processed successfully. Upload the next secret. Remaining secrets: 1
    ```

    The Coordinator log shows the following:

    ```json
    {"level":"info","ts":1674206799.524596,"caller":"clientapi/clientapi.go:234","msg":"Recover called"}
    {"level":"info","ts":1674206799.524596,"caller":"clientapi/clientapi.go:253","msg":"Recover: recovery incomplete, more keys needed","remaining":1}
    ```

3. Bob does the same with his key to complete the recovery procedure:

    ```shell-session
    $ marblerun status $MARBLERUN
    1: Coordinator is in recovery mode. Either upload a key to unseal the saved state, or set a new manifest. For more information on how to proceed, consult the documentation.
    $ echo "bvPzio4A4SvzeHajsb+dFDpDarErcU9wMR0V9hyHtG2lC4ZfyrYjDBE7wtis3eOPgDaMG/HCt=" > recovery_data
    $ openssl base64 -d -in recovery_data > recovery_key_encrypted
    $ marblerun recover recovery_key_encrypted $MARBLERUN --key private_key.pem
    Successfully verified Coordinator, now uploading key
    Recovery successful.
    $ marblerun status $MARBLERUN
    3: Coordinator is running correctly and ready to accept marbles.
    ```

    The Coordinator log shows the following:

    ```json
    {"level":"info","ts":1674206836.5523517,"caller":"clientapi/clientapi.go:234","msg":"Recover called"}
    {"level":"info","ts":1674206836.5563517,"caller":"core/core.go:261","msg":"generating quote"}
    {"level":"info","ts":1674206836.6043515,"caller":"clientapi/clientapi.go:281","msg":"Recover successful"}
    ```
