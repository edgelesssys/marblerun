# Coordinator
## Build
To build both the host and enclave parts:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

```

To build the marble-dummy host and enclave parts for testing:
```
cd premain
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make 
```

## Run
```
OE_SIMULATION=1 ./coordinator
```
## Test (//TODO)
```
go test test/integration_test.go -v --args -c ../build/coordinator -m ../premain/build/marble
```

# Protobuf
## Build

To update the protobuf defintion, you need to have the `protoc` compiler and the corresponding Go plugin `protoc-gen-go` installed. Please follow the instructions [here](https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/go/). (There is no need to install the `gRPC` module as it will be fetched automatically.)

Once `protoc` is installed, run the following to update protobuf definitions.
```bash
go generate
```

## Test

```
go test
```
